I am a high school student currently attending William Henry Harrison High School (Graduating '23). I am interested in computer science, and have participated in the USACO competition series as well as auditing for web3 Smart Contracts on Code4rena and Immunefi. I am the co-founder of the competetive programming club at my high school. I am also an avid runner, participating in both track and cross-country, which I have lettered in.
